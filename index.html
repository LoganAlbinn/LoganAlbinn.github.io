    <h2>
         I am a second-year student at Oregon State University Cascades, working towards a degree in computer science. As a native of Bend, Oregon, I loved growing up with the mountains in my back yard. Outside the classroom, I indulge in playing the guitar, an activity that that not only serves as a creative outlet but also enhances my analytical skills through music's structured yet artistic nature. I am committed to leveraging both my technical skills and personal interests to push the boundaries of technology.
